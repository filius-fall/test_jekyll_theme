### Learnt new things

Today i learnt important things from reading the book "The Atomic Habits".
Main points i learned are:

- System is more important than Goals.
- Behavioral change doesnt come if the thing we want to change doesnt align with our identity.

__Explination__

If the goals are the things that set apart losers and winners then there will be ton of winners because most of them has the same goal so its the system they built that made them a winner so ****The System built is more important than the Goal**** and if we make the goal priority we tend to slack off more after we acheieved the goal and revert back to our bad habits. 

The main reason most of us cant keep a good habit is because the change we need dont align with our identity, for example if we want to save money but we keep spending more than we earn we cant ever make it a habit. 

So if you want to start a habit you should have the mentality that "I am a person that do this", for example when i am start a habit if excercising i should have the mentatlity that "i am a person who excerises", if i am starting to write i should make my identity as a writer. This is very important for the habits to stick long

__Conclusion__

So now i will be the person who writes and make my identity as a writer and i will be the person who workout daily and i will work on building my own system.
