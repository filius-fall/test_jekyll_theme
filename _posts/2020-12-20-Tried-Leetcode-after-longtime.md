### General



Start of the day wasnt productive today. I did my morning chores today. I couldnt go for trekking since my knee was injured so instead i went to haircut. My father gave us a suprise visit today so i spent most day with him and other stuff. I went for walk in evening and returned at 6 30 PM. But still i tried to learn a new thing inspite of being not wanting to study anything and just want to watch youtube videos. I am trying to become person i want to be so i am doing the actions which will make me that person that is a ****Good Programmer****
