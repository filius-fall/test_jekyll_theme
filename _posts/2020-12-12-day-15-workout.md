# Changes i obsereved

I lost upto 5 kgs of weight in these 15 days of workout.
I think this is the right moment in my life to take care of my body and health, so i joined a Gym and also started doing jumping rope.

After doing this for 15 days i can feel differences in my mood and energy levels, before i was very lazy guy most of the time i procrastinated and main the remorse that comes after wasting time is the worst, but now i can observe i am procrastinating less and feel motivated to start working.

Most of the people listen to songs while workout, in my experience thats the worst thing workout isnt only for the body its also for the brain also the presence of mind while experiencing the pain is the most important part, if you are listening to songs you are cheating.
