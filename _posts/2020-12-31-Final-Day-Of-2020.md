After a gruesome amount of work i finally got my Provisional certificate from my university today.

I never expected my grades will go up after final semester, what i expected was 6.47 but what i got was 6.88 for many it may be low but i am proud of my score. This at least gets me eligible to apply for some companies who has minimum criteria for 65%.

### End of 2020

---------------------

I cant describe this year. There was both positives and negatives to this year. Overall i can say it is leaning negative somewhat.

Start of this year was good for me. I started to code more and learnt many things but then the pandemic happened. I wasted most of the time, may be i utilised 30% time. but it taught me i should never complain about lack of time because when i had the unlimited time during lockdown i didn't use it much so i learnt it all comes to ones mentality so time isn't the problem at all.

Positive things are i started to read books and started working-out which are good things and i feel like this is right time to start them



I hope i learn from my mistakes and make myself better in 2021
