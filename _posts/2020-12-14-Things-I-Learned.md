#### Not a productive day

Only useful thing i did today is excersises and Jump rope.

Other than that today is wasted day. I only watched youtube all day. I am a big CS:GO fan. I watcehd yesterday Blast Global finals Astralis vs Team Vitality, and remaining time i just browsed twitter, I will try not to waste my time tommorow

I also learnt a interesting thing today about investments from Naval Ravikanth, i learnt importance of investing, i want to try them once i start earinig.

You could also Google and look up about him, very intersting guy, lots to learn from him
