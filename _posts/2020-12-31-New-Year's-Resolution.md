I always thought new year's resolution was dumb. if we really should do a thing we should have done it immediately not wait until January 1. But i see some upsides of it also its easier to start a new habit on these days but sticking to it completely depends on the individual. So here i am trying to start new habits and better my life 1% at a time for each day.
