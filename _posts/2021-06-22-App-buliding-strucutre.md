The below will be a rough idea of how I should build this app I mentioned in Previous posts



1. Basic HTML page with variable or fixed containers based on future ideas
2. Learn to interact site with Linux shell commands
3. Learn to create custom Shell commands using Click or any suitable python library
4. Implement it into the application

This above is one of the feature of the app. First task is to complete this then I have to proceed with using Discord bot and creating an API
