For the new page I am building I want to compartmentalise the application into many small containers.

Each container has different application and maybe different API so that each work independent of others

For now I want to add

1. My main purpose for links and TIL display
2. HLTV match details (Maybe specific team)
3. Siddha Performance posts updates
4. Tweets of selected persons
5. Any YouTube notifications of particular channel or some sort

and also clicking on each container should reroute to another page of the clicked content
