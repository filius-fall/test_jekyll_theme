Sometimes as I scroll through YouTube I come across some good videos or when browsing for articles on programming or science I come across good articles which I want to read after some time or store the link for future readings.

So I want to make an application or website which stores them but every time I want to add a Link I cant open the website files and add the post. So I want to create a script and a Discord bot so that they add to the website.

**So the features I want to add are**

1. I can add links from terminal like

   ```
   $ <app-name> <link> --options
   ```

   

2. I can add using Discord Bot. That is when I message a bot it will upload on website



And the main feature I want to add is Website's own API to interact with script and Discord bot



My Cousin has already this kind of app called sarathi, Which is a discord bot which will push the message to _posts of Jekyll site repo in his GitHub which reloads his sites. 

But I want to take another route by incorporating an API.

Main objective of this application is to use time efficiently and complete work as fast as possible
