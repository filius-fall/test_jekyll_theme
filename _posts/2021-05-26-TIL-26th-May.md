I have been using Linux for over 3 years but i still use GUI functions so I decided to work on using commands instead of relying on GUI so today I practised removing and copying files and directories



For copying:

```
cp *filetobecopied* *dest*
```



To copy only the files of folder:

```
cp -a /*dir-name*/. *dest*
```





Deleting a dir:

```
rmdr *dir-name*
```

the above doesn't work all times because if directory has files it wont remove the directory.  

Instead you can use "rm"  

```
rm *file*
```

but to remove a dir it shows an error so we have to use -r  

```
rm -r *dir-name*
```

# Diet related

Today I studied about some diet related videos just to keep my health in good state.

Links:

[How fat accumulates in our body and why we get hungry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHaCKudtVi0&t=432s)

[Why sugar is as bad as alcohol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHaCKudtVi0&t=432s)

[Do calories matter?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcMBm-UVdII&t=566s)



Main things I learnt are :

​		1) fibre is important

​		2) Sugar is super bad

​		3) Eating vegetables and fruits are way better than drinking their juice

​		4) Eating rice is not feasible and combination of vegetables and fruits must be kept in mind
