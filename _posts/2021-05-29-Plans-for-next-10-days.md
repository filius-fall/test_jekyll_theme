Starting to learn new things. I was planning to start learning about databases so first thing in my mind is Postgresql and redis



PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

Redis, which stands for **Re**mote **Di**ctionary **S**erver, is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data store for use as a database, cache, message broker, and queue.

so the posts for almost 10 days will be mostly of them

29th May and 30th May I am planing to complete chapter 16 which is regarding installation of Postgresql and chapter 1-6 

Before these I am planning to learn Cachetools library in python.

This module provides various memorising collections and decorators, including variants of the Python Standard Libraryâ€™s [@lru_cache](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache) function decorator.
